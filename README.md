# SimpleDesktopMonitor
A very simple desktop monitor written in Python, which logs to a .txt file. Just a quick config and that's all. 
You will need to pip install pywin32 in order to use it.

Use case: you want to know if you're spending too much time idle or actually working, you're looking for a bootstrap solution for monitoring users, this is your script.
