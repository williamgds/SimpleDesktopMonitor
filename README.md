# SimpleDesktopMonitor
A very simple desktop monitor written in Python, which logs to a .txt file. Just a quick config and that's all. 
You will need to pip install pywin32 in order to use it.

Use case: you want to know if you're spending too much time idle or actually working, you're looking for a bootstrap solution for monitoring users, this is your script.

## First things first

1. Cmd ```pip install pywin32``` before anything else. (This is intended for Windows environments)
2. Open ```Cfg.py``` and edit the variables to your preferences.
3. Let it run

TO-DOs: will add an aborted execution message when the user shuts down the computer.
